| April 5   |    9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| January 6 |  9:40-9:55   |                                                                                                                                                    Started bainstorming what to potential do. Decided to use DFS since that was what I was trying to do on my final and I thought it was a good idea |
| January 7 |   2:15- 3    |                                                   Continued working on my boggle. Created a Trie class to hold all my dictionary words. Also created a check method that checks for whether the new square is valid in the board and a check method for wether the square is valid in the dictionary |
| January 9 |   10-10:40   |                                                                                                                                                                                                   Finalised my first attempt for boggle. Finished Trie and all its methods and fnished my dfs method |
| January 9 | 12:35 - 1:15 | Tried my code turns out their were a couple out of bound errors from not have my valid check for board length -1 instead of board length. ALso noticed typo where I did word += word + new charcater instead of just word + new character. Now the code currently passes the correct small test case |
| January 9 | 1:15 - 1:27  |                                                                                                                                                                        Forgot to check for duplicate words. After adding a second trie for checking for duplicate words it now passes all test cases |
| January 9 |  1:30-1:40   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Added comments |
